# Advent of Code 2020
These are my solutions for the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Don't expect this to be maintained, I might miss some days or even stop prematurely.

## Running
Install `cargo-aoc`.  
```
cargo install cargo-aoc
```
Then, to run the solutions:  
```
cargo aoc 
# or cargo aoc -d <day number>
```

The utility also provides benchmarking, with:
```
cargo aoc bench
```
